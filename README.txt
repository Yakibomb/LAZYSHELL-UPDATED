LAZYSHELL++
Super Mario RPG Editor 
Version: 2.1.5
Date: March 1, 2025

LAZYSHELL++ (formerly "LAZY SHELL: UPDATED EDITION") is a fork by Yakibomb (author of this github).
This was made from Lazy Shell 3.19.0 Source Code, which was created by Giangurgolo and Omega

This fork features a lot of bug fixes and quality-of-life changes from the version 3.19.0 release. Some changes include:
 - Dialogues editor no longer corrupts dialogue (fixed by Doomsday31415),
 - Levels editor has a "Flat Mode", which visually reduces solidity tiles to floor level (so you can actually see what you're editting) (suggested by Will319),
 - An IPS patch database (under "Patches" in the editor) connects to Github with a lot of different IPS patches. Can also connect to your own Github or web server for additional patch databases.
 
There's more!
 - The "Project Notes" is more functional and reliable,
 - Updated icons (including jumbo sized editor icons),
 - Documents more commands in Event Scripts and Animation Scripts,
 - More things to edit in Animation Scripts,
 - A level-up calculator in Allies editor, which gives the sum of stats from level-ups,
 - World Maps editor can edit sprite graphics,
 - Menus editor is less buggy and has more features to edit tilemaps,
 - Title editor has a title preview with configurable title attributes,
 - and I think that's the bulk of it!
